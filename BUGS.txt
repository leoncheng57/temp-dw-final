BUGS

If the number of clients connecting is greater than (and not equal to) the desired number, then those extra clients will freeze (they will not exit themselves)

Drawing a card does not work.

The action cards (draw2, wild, reverse, skip) may not work properly.
They work usually but may occasionally not produce the desired effect.

Server and clients do not exit when a player wins, only the winner exits.
