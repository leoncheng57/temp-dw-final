BUGS
Client could only connect to the server once. [FIXED]A few weeks ago?

Could not implement turns. Attempted to use Child PIDs and SOCKFDs to determine turns. [FIXED]1/17
Used shared memory instead to determine turns


Unable to send last card played [FIXED]1/25
Tried to write and read multiple times. Realized we could just send a struct.

If the number of clients connecting is greater than (and not equal to) the desired number, then those extra 
clients will freeze (they will not exit themselves)

Drawing a card does not work. [FIXED]1/25

The action cards (draw2, wild, reverse, skip) do not work as intended.

Draw 2 - Does not work [AMENDED]1/24 
Draws 2 for the player but does not carry on to the next player if the current player has a draw 2
or draw 4. 

Draw 4 - Does not work [AMENDED]1/24
Draws 4 for the player but does not carry on to the next player if the current player has a draw 2
or draw 4. 

Any Wilds - Does not work [AMENDED]1/25
Instead of asking the player for color (we tried to do that but encountered seg fault) only able to put
down the wild. Cannot choose color. Instead next player is able to put down any color.

Reverse - Does not work
We used shared memory to implement reverse. Inside shared mem is an array of ints and index 3 holds a odd or 
even number (1 or 2). Alternate between the 2 numbers when reverse is played to switch directions. Seg fault
(we believe it might be server issue) when trying to do so. 

Server and clients do not exit when a player wins, only the winner exits.
We set the array[1] inside shared memory to be 100. This is the callsign for clients to exit. Inside each
client there is a check for whether or not color is equal to 100. If it is exit. Unfortunately only winner
exits
