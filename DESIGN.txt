Uno Card Game

Andy Tso, Eric He, and Leon Cheng
Period 8


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
We aim to recreate the card game Uno, mainly working in the terminal. There can be as many players as desired (multiplayer). The objective of the game is to discard all your cards by playing them. We plan to have the server on one computer and the players on computers of their own. The server will deal the hands to the players while whatever card a player plays will be sent to the server which in turn will be sent to all the other players.
Some simple rules:
   1. If the previous card is a number card, your card may either be the same color or value. You may also choose to draw a card.
   2. If the previous card is an action card (ie Draw 2, Wild Card, Wild Draw 4, Skip, Reverse), then we will check for combos and apply the correct action
   3. First player to discard all cards wins.

HOW TO USE:
Once user can create the game. Others can join the game. 

The server will be created when the first user creates the game. It will follow the same pattern as fserver. Two programs will be made where one will be initiated by the server while the other program is to be initiated by the other joining players.

CONCEPTS USED:
Allocating memory.
Signals (for quitting the game)
Pipes (named and unnamed for the server).
Networking and Sockets (multiplayer game, to connect between multiple computers).
Shared Memory (to share data between server and its child processes).

DATA STRUCTURES USED:
Stack (for storing played cards; need to know the last card played)
Queues (for storing order of players)
Structs (to store players and cards)
Arrays (to store cards, players, ints, etc)

ADDITIONAL IDEAS (TIME-ALLOWING):
Make Cards look better graphically, like with ASCII 
Add chat server
